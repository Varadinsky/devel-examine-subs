Revision history for Devel-Examine::Subs

1.39    20150921
        - Tie::File no longer needed, we have our own built-in read/write methods
        - upon reading in a file, the line endings are saved, then completely removed
          prior to the file array being populated. Upon write, the saved line endings
          are added back in to each line
        - hundreds of new tests across numerous files
        - fixed a couple bugs in inject_after() relating to Tie::File removal
        - modules now have their version applied in the 'package' line
        - min perl version is 5.012;

1.35    20150917
        - reworked Makefile.PL, allows tests on MSWin32 to pass
        - we now look in all files to determine and set line-ending
          characters program-wide
        - added a '\r\n' file and added a test

1.33    20150916
        - re-added Devel::Trace::Subs integration in a way that the module
          won't break install if DTS isn't installed

1.32    20150915
        - moved repo from bitbucket to https://github.com/stevieb9/devel-examine-subs
        - removed Devel::Trace::Subs integration... breaks CPAN install because of
          the circular dependency

1.31    20150915
        - Devel::Trace::Subs has been introduced. See DEBUGGING in
          'perldoc Devel::Examine::Subs'

        - all public methods (less run()) now take a hash as params
          (as opposed to hash ref).
        - pre_filters are now accepted in an aref if there are more than one:

        - fixes bug 56: allow 'file' param to be a module name
        - params are separated into persistent and transient
        - all params are now validated
        - transient params get reset after each run()

        - countless bug fixes        

1.17    20150715
        - implemented PPI sub checking, much safer
        - removed the old _subs() that was not PPI-based
        - most everything is OO based now
        - all core parameters are set into $self through _config()
        - basic consolodation of error checking in _config()
        - extensive refactoring to make tests pass
        - separate out the ::Sub.pm module into its own file

        - bug 14 fix: add file validation: done in _config()
        - bug 13 fix: new() now accepts 'file' param
        - new test for 'search'
        - many other test additions/updates
        - test for ::Sub

1.07    20150630
        - added sublist()

          methods
